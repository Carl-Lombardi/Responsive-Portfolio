        <p class="first">Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Carl Lombardi and I am an aspiring full-stack
          developer, aiming to bring a fresh perspective to the industry. I began my career in the insurance field, working over nine
          years at American International Group in the Excess Casualty Claims department. After departing from AIG, I have decided to make a career change into development.</p>
        <p>When it comes to aesthetics, I tend to favor a clean, minimilist style with splashes of color where appropriate. I believe the best websites are easy to navigate, do more with less, and allow the end user to explore freely.</p>
        <p>I am a 2009 graduate of Fairfield University in Fairfield, CT, with a B.A. in English/Journalism. I spent the summers of 2005 and 2006 as a play-by-play and color commentator for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball on WVOF. In 2006, I was a member of the broadcast team for the 2006 ALPB All Star Game from the Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, CT.</p>
        <p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid fan of hockey, retro video games and record collecting. I own over 300
          vinyl records spanning all genres of music, and enjoy listening to them in my spare time. Some of my favorite
          albums include "Progress" by RX Bandits, "Tommy" by The Who, "Damaged" by Black Flag and The Doors self
          titled album.</p>
